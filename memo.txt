> By default, Turbo doesnâ€™t add the text/vnd.turbo-stream.html MIME type when submitting links, or forms with a method type of GET. To use Turbo Streams responses with GET requests in an application you can instruct Turbo to include the MIME type by adding a data-turbo-stream attribute to a link or form.
